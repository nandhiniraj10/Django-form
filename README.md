**PROJECT OVERVIEW:**<br>
This project is a simple web application built using Django, where users can input personal data through a form and save it to a database. The core functionality is to collect and store information entered by users via a PersonForm, which represents a Django form tied to a Person model. Upon submission, the form is validated, and if the data is valid, it is saved in the database. After the form submission, the user is redirected to a success page.<br>

**Key features:**<br>
**Form Handling:** The PersonForm captures user input, such as name, age, or other personal details.*<br>
**Validation and Saving:** The form data is validated before being saved into the database.<br>
**Success Redirection:** After successfully saving the data, users are redirected to a confirmation page.<br>
**Template Rendering:** Uses Djangoâ€™s template system to render the form and success pages.<br>
This project demonstrates how to handle form submissions, validate data, and store user inputs in a Django-based web application. It is ideal for beginner developers learning form handling and database integration in Django.<br>
